## About Me

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][PEI-Lab]. My research focuses on multimodal sensing and cross-modal inference, integrating embedded sensor networks, heterogeneous data, and machine learning to reveal environmental and urban dynamics that lie beyond any single sensing modality. I'm a [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow][DOE-CSGF] and the Editor-in-Chief for [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS].
