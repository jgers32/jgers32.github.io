## About Me

I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang] as a member of the [NohPei Lab][NohPei]. I'm majoring in Embedded Systems with a focus on building hardware, systems, and wireless sensing networks to solve unique environmental and community issues. In my free time, I enjoy using IoT for side projects, 3D printing, transforming old devices into PCB art, and web development.

Previously, I got my B.Sc. in both Computer Science and Applied Math at [Baldwin Wallace University][B-W] where I was a member of the <b>M</b>obile & I<b>o</b>T for <b>P</b>lanet and <b>S</b>ociety [(MOPS) Research Group][MOPS] under my advisor, [Brian Krupp][Brian-Krupp]. (bonus: he created [Ducky Weather][ducky], a simple yet elegant weather app that doesn't sell your location data â˜º )

<i>I currently serve as the 'Labz' Department Editor for the student-led [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS] -- email me if you are interested in having your research highlighted!</i>

## Research Interests

- **Embedded Systems:** internet-of-things, mobile computing, ubiqutious networks
- **Sensing Networks:** wireless, environmental, & health sensing
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** interaction techniques, community empowerment

My undergraduate research focused on a low-cost, low-power solution for Air Quality sensing with Internet-of-Things ([AQIoT][AQ-IoT]), a mobile application to promote food recovery and reduce food waste, food insecurity, and student hunger on college campuses ([Campus Plate][Campus-Plate]), and combining machine learning models with audio/visual data to enhance a smart classroom sensing system ([EduSense][Edu-Sense]).
