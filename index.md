## About Me

I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang]. My research spans mobile computing, sensor networks, and human-centered computing. I’m particularly interested in building sensing networks and smart systems that address environmental and community challenges. 

I’m a [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow][DOE-CSGF] (DOE CSGF), supporting my research on a vehicular multimodal sensing system paired with high-performance computing to monitor and analyze rapidly changing urban conditions. Additionally, I'm a [NSF Center for Pandemic Insights][NSF-CPI] Trainee, contributing to the development and networking of multimodal sensor systems for detecting pathogens, disease outbreaks, and key environmental events.

Outside of research, I serve as the Labz Editor for [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS], a software mentor for the [PiHi Samurai][PiHi] FIRST Robotics team, and am constantly working on too many [side projects][maker]!

## Research Interests

- **Embedded & Mobile Systems:** IoT, mobile computing, edge sensing
- **Sensing Networks:** urban & environmental monitoring, health sensing
- **Human-Centered Computing:** ubiquitous systems, real-world validation
