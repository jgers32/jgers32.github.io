## About Me

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], where I’m advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang]. My research spans Mobile Computing & Sensing, Embedded Systems, and Human-Centered Computing. I’m particularly interested in building sensing networks and multimodal systems to address environmental and community challenges. 

I’m an incoming [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow][DOE_CSGF] (DOE CSGF), which will support my research on a vehicular multimodal sensing system that combines vision and air quality data alongside high performance computing for real-time monitoring and analysis of rapidly changing urban conditions. This work aims to help cities respond more equitably and efficiently allocate resources where they’re needed most, particularly in areas affected by homelessness.

Outside of research, I serve as the Labz Editor for [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS], where I highlight student research projects from across the globe — email me if you’re interested in having your work featured!

## Research Interests

- **Embedded Systems:** internet-of-things, mobile computing  
- **Sensing Networks:** urban, environmental, and health sensing  
- **Human-Centered Computing:** ubiquitous systems, real-world deployments
