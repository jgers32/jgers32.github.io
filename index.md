## About Me

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang] in the [Pervasive Electronics Innovations (PEI) Lab][PEI-Lab]. I specialize in **multimodal sensing and cross-modal inference**, developing approaches that combine embedded hardware, heterogeneous data, and machine learning to **infer hidden environmental and urban context**, i.e. phenomena that are often beyond the reach of any single sensing modality or cannot be directly measured. My work takes a **human-centered approach**, focusing on how these insights can inform environmental understanding, urban resilience, and data-driven smart-city systems.

I'm a [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow][DOE-CSGF] (DOE CSGF), supporting my work on vehicular multimodal sensing systems coupled with high-performance computing to monitor and analyze rapidly changing urban conditions. In parallel, as a [NSF Center for Pandemic Insights][NSF-CPI] Trainee, I focus on developing and networking robust multimodal ‚Äúeverything‚Äù sensors that integrate thermal, acoustic, visual, and air-quality modalities for environmental and bat activity monitoring.
