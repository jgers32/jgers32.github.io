## About Me

I am an incoming Electrical & Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], to be advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang] as a member of the 'Structures as Sensors' lab. I am currently finishing up my B.Sc. in both Computer Science and Applied Math at [Baldwin Wallace University][B-W] and am a member of the [Mobile & IoT for Planet and Society (MOPS) Research Group][MOPS] under my advisor, [Brian Krupp][Brian-Krupp]. I also serve as the 'Labz' Department Editor for the student-led [ACM XRDS][ACM-XRDS] Magazine. 

## Research Interests

- **Embedded Systems:** internet-of-things, mobile computing, ubiqutious sensing
- **Sensing Networks:** wireless networks, environmental sensing, mobile health sensing
- **Machine Learning:** applied models, classification algorithms, sensing system integration
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** interaction techniques, community empowerment

My undergraduate research focused on a low-cost, low-power solution for Air Quality sensing with Internet-of-Things ([AQIoT][AQ-IoT]), a mobile application to promote food recovery and reduce food waste, food insecurity, and student hunger on college campuses ([Campus Plate][Campus-Plate]), and combining machine learning models with audio/visual data to enhance a smart classroom sensing system ([EduSense][Edu-Sense]).
