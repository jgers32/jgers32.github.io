## About Me

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang] in the [Pervasive Electronics Innovations (PEI) Lab][PEI-Lab]. My research spans mobile computing, urban and environmental sensing, and applied machine learning. I'm especially interested in developing and deploying smart sensing networks to address environmental and community challenges.

I'm a [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow][DOE-CSGF] (DOE CSGF), supporting my research on a vehicular multimodal sensing system paired with high-performance computing to monitor and analyze rapidly changing urban conditions. Additionally, I'm a [NSF Center for Pandemic Insights][NSF-CPI] Trainee, contributing to the development and networking of multimodal sensor systems for detecting pathogens, disease outbreaks, and key environmental events.
