## About Me

I'm a first-year Electrical & Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang]. I am passionate about building embedded sensing systems to solve unique environmental and community issues. In my free time, I enjoy using IoT for side projects, creating custom 3D prints, transforming old devices into PCB art, and building iOS apps with unique APIs.

Previously, I got my B.Sc. in both Computer Science and Applied Math at [Baldwin Wallace University][B-W] where I was a member of the [Mobile & IoT for Planet and Society (MOPS) Research Group](images/research/mops-archive.pdf) under my advisor, [Brian Krupp][Brian-Krupp]. (bonus: he created [Ducky Weather][ducky], a simple yet elegant weather app that doesn't sell your location data â˜º )

 I currently serve as the 'Labz' Department Editor for the student-led [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS] -- email me if you are interested in having your research highlighted!

## Research Interests

- **Embedded Systems:** internet-of-things, mobile computing, ubiqutious sensing
- **Sensing Networks:** wireless networks, environmental sensing, mobile health sensing
- **Machine Learning:** applied models, data science, classification algorithms
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** interaction techniques, community empowerment

My undergraduate research focused on a low-cost, low-power solution for Air Quality sensing with Internet-of-Things ([AQIoT][AQ-IoT]), a mobile application to promote food recovery and reduce food waste, food insecurity, and student hunger on college campuses ([Campus Plate][Campus-Plate]), and combining machine learning models with audio/visual data to enhance a smart classroom sensing system ([EduSense][Edu-Sense]).
