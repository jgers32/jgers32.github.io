## About Me

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan](#U-Mich), advised by [Pei Zhang](#Pei-Zhang). My research focuses on developing multimodal sensing networks and intelligent systems for environmental monitoring and smart communities, including [vehicular environmental monitoring](#neighbor-drive) and [virus detection](#CPI). I also serve as the [ACM XRDS Magazine](#ACM-XRDS) Labz Editor â€“ *email me to feature your research*!

<!--  I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from [Baldwin Wallace University][B-W], where I was a member of the [Mobile & IoT for Planet and Society Research Group][MOPS] under [Brian Krupp][Brian-Krupp]. (Fun fact: he developed [Ducky Weather][ducky], a weather app that respects your privacy!) -->

## Research Interests

- **Embedded Systems:** internet-of-things, mobile computing
- **Sensing Networks:** wireless, environmental, and health sensing
- **Human-Centered Computing:** ubiquitous and pervasive networks
