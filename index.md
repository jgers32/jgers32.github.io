## About Me

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], where I’m advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang]. My research spans Embedded Systems, Human-Centered Computing, Mobile Computing & Sensing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). I’m particularly interested in building sensing networks and mobile multimodal sensing systems that address environmental and community challenges. I’m an incoming [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow][DOE_CSGF] (DOE CSGF), where my research will focus on integrating large-scale data collection, high-performance computing, and real-world sensing to support responsive, equitable, and data-driven urban environments. This work aims to develop systems capable of monitoring and analyzing rapidly changing city conditions to better serve its communities.

Outside of research, I serve as the Labz Editor for [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS], where I highlight emerging technologies, student projects, and creative applications of computing — reach out if you’d like your work featured!
