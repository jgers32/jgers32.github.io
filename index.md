## About Me

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan][U-Mich], advised by [Pei Zhang][Pei-Zhang]. I'm majoring in Embedded Systems, with a focus on building hardware, systems, and sensing networks to address environmental and community challenges. My current research focuses on developing multimodal sensing networks and intelligent systems for applications such as vehicular environmental monitoring and virus detection. I also serve as the [ACM XRDS Magazine][ACM-XRDS] Labz Editor – *email me to feature your research*!

## Research Interests

- **Embedded Systems:** internet-of-things, mobile computing  
- **Sensing Networks:** wireless, environmental, and health sensing  
- **Human-Centered Computing:** ubiquitous and pervasive networks
