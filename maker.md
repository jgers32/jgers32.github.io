    <p>Hey! Welcome to the <em>maker</em> side of my site!</p>

    <p>Outside of research, I love 3D printing, building my home lab, hooking up new sensors for either my balcony weather station, green house garden, or my hedgehog's <i>smart home</i> ðŸ¦”, as well as repurposing old tech as futuristic decor and wall art.</p>

    <p>This portion is still under construction, so for now visit my <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a> for my maker work :) </p>
