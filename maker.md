    <p>Hey! Welcome to the <em>fun side</em> of my site!</p>

    <p>Outside of research, I love working on 3D prints, building my home lab, hooking up new sensors for my balcony weather station, green house garden, & my hedgehog's <i>smart home</i> ðŸ¦”, as well as repurposing old tech as futuristic decor and wall art.</p>
